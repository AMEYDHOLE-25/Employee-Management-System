# Employee-Management-System

In this employee management system ,I have 
Done the analysis of the employees in an 
IT company...based on their performances..
This would really help the employers to understand
the performances of the employees in their 
and moreover there are 14 different functions 
for exploring the employees performance...
Starting from addition of employees to sustaining 
them in the company....So go and just explore
the wonderfull analysis done by me...
So hope u like this...one
And would continue to make such projects...Try 
Running this code on Turbo C++ as it contains 
some garphics portion that might not be visible
on any other compiler...
So, Thanks for reading this...hope u enjoy it..
